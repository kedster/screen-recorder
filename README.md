## Setup

### Local Development (Node.js)

1. Install dependencies:
```powershell
# PowerShell (temporary execution policy for npm)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass;
npm install
```

2. Optional: Install ffmpeg for MP4 conversion
- Download ffmpeg from ffmpeg.org
- Add to PATH or copy ffmpeg.exe to a directory in PATH
- Check installation: `ffmpeg -version`

3. Start the server:
```powershell
npm start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

### Cloudflare Development

1. Install dependencies and Wrangler:
```bash
npm install
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. Authenticate with Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Start Worker development server:
```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

4. Build frontend for Pages:
```bash
npm run build:pages
```

See [Cloudflare Deployment Guide](CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for production deployment.

## Notes

- Screen/tab capture requires Chrome with "Share audio" enabled
- If lamejs fails to load, audio uploads as WebM
- Without ffmpeg, screen recordings stay in WebM format
- For better quality, ffmpeg converts WebM ‚Üí MP4 server-side

Server-side MP4 conversion:
- The server will attempt to convert uploaded WebM video to MP4 using `ffmpeg` if it's installed and on PATH
- If ffmpeg is not available, the original WebM will be kept
- The conversion uses H.264 video and AAC audio codecs for maximum compatibility
- Client-side conversion is attempted first, falling back to server-side if unavailable
- Users receive clear feedback about conversion status through toast notifications

Windows notes:
- On Windows PowerShell you may see an execution policy error when running npm scripts. Run these commands in PowerShell to use npm:

```powershell
# temporarily allow node's npm wrapper to run this session
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass;
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively run node directly:

```powershell
node server.js
```
